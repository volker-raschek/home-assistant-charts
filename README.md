## Customization

### Mountpoints

As default all configuration and media files will be stored inside the container
filesystem. Inside the `values.yaml` files the sections `volumes` and
`volumeMounts` to mount additional volumes inside the container. For example to
mount the directories containing configuration and media files on separate
mountpoints. The `values.yaml` contains also some examples to mount the
directories inside the host filesystem.

#### Troubleshooting

The application use as backend a sqlite database. If the database is stored on a
network filesystem like nfs, it is quite possible that the application lacks or
is unusable, because sqlite is not designed to be used as a database accesses
over network.
